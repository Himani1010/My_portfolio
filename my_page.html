    <!-- <h2>Incomprehensibility or readability? That is the question.
    </h2>
    <p>
        The most well-known dummy text is the 'Lorem Ipsum', which is said to
        have originated in the 16th century. Lorem Ipsum is composed in a
        pseudo-Latin language which more or less corresponds to 'proper' Latin.
        It contains a series of real Latin words. This ancient dummy text is
        also incomprehensible, but it imitates the rhythm of most European
        languages in Latin script. The advantage of its Latin origin and the
        relative meaninglessness of Lorum Ipsum is that the text does not
        attract attention to itself or distract the viewer's attention from the
        layout.
